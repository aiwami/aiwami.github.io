    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Asian Indian Women's Association (AIWA) was a dream of a few women who
      were first generation wives coming to this country with their husbands,
      leaving the only home they knew and their families thousands of miles
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      A group of women, who made a home in a new world, raised and educated
      children, watched these children get married and build families of their
      own. Throughout all this, they noted the lessons they learned and were
      determined of the importance of sharing them with more women as they come
      to this country and to their daughters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years, they have seen the impact of poor health and lack of
      understanding prevention effect their spouses as well as themselves. They
      saw women put in situations of financial distress and not knowing what to
      do. These women wanted to create a safe haven where other women like
      themselves can pro-actively learn, share and collaborate.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a second generation Asian Indian woman who has had the opportunity
      and advantage of everything this country has to offer. But the question
      is: do I know what to do? Do I know the importance of taking care of
      myself, keeping myself educated on the challenges of life? Just because I
      was raised in America and educated in America doesn’t necessarily mean I
      know how to care for myself and my family.
    </p>
    <p>
      AIWA has opened my eyes to the power of women. I have seen first hand how
      teamwork, common goals and hard work can raise awareness. Over the last
      few years, I have seen at least one women leave an AIWA event having
      learned something very important to them!
    </p>
    <p>
      I myself have a daughter, who is growing up in a completely different
      world than I did. She will face challenges and I look to AIWA to help me
      as I raise her to be a strong Asian Indian Woman in a world where women
      have so many opportunities. I also look to AIWA to remind me of my
      culture and give me the ability to share it with my children.
