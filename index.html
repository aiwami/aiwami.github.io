    What does Asian Indian Women’s Association mean?
  </h2>

  <p>
    Asian Indian Women's Association (AIWA) was a dream of a few women who were
    first generation wives coming to this country with their husbands, leaving
    the only home they knew and their families thousands of miles away.
  </p>

  <p>
    A group of women, who made a home in a new world, raised and educated
    children, watched these children get married and build families of their own.
    Throughout all this, they noted the lessons they learned and were determined
    of the importance of sharing them with more women as they come to this
    country and to their daughters.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over the years, they have seen the impact of poor health and lack of
    understanding prevention effect their spouses as well as themselves.  They
    saw women put in situations of financial distress and not knowing what to do.
    These women wanted to create a safe haven where other women like themselves
    can pro-actively learn, share and collaborate.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am a second generation Asian Indian woman who has had the opportunity and
    advantage of everything this country has to offer.  But the question is: do I
    know what to do?  Do I know the importance of taking care of myself, keeping
    myself educated on the challenges of life?  Just because I was raised in
    America and educated in America doesn’t necessarily mean I know how to care
    for myself and my family.
  </p>

  <p>
    AIWA has opened my eyes to the power of women.  I have seen first hand how
    teamwork, common goals and hard work can raise awareness.  Over the last few
    years, I have seen at least one women leave an AIWA event having learned
    something very important to them!
  </p>

  <p>
    I myself have a daughter, who is growing up in a completely different world
    than I did.  She will face challenges and I look to AIWA to help me as I
    raise her to be a strong Asian Indian Woman in a world where women have so
    many opportunities.  I also look to AIWA to remind me of my culture and give
    me the ability to share it with my children.
